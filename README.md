Welcome to my first self-build landing page.

In this project I am going to build a landing page with HTML and CSS using mainly flexbox. 

The project is the ending project of the CSS part in "The Odin Project". The design is given by the project as well as the overall structure, everything concerning code has to be written by me.

I will first build the structure and then fill it with some content I think will make sense within the structure.
